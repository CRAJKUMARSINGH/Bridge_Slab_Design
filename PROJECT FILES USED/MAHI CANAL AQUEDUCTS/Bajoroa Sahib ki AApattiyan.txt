	Sub: Proof checking of Design of Trough Aquaduct
 
	I have checked the design and drawings submitted to me for design of trough Aquaduct across river Som and Jakham. Kindly ask the consultant to further carry and the following analysis/design and submit to myself. 
 
1-      load due to water pressure to be considered on walls of trough section
2-      The section to be modeled as a whole "C" section vather than slabe supported on side beams.
3-      The slab is on tension side of "C"  section. Provide ……… to avoid concrete …… thickness of slab.
4-      Consider negative bending moment in bottom slab due to continuity from side wall junction.
5-      Side wall to be designed for tension and bending moments @two axes (vertical & horizontal)
6-      consider wind load on trough walls and piers.
