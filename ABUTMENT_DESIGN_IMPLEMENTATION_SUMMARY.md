- Live load considerations (deck reactions)
- Side-by-side comparison of both abutment types
- Professional cross-section drawings
- Real-time design status monitoring

##### 2. **STABILITY ANALYSIS**
- **Earth Pressure Calculations:**
  ```
  Active: Ka = tan²(45° - φ/2)
  Passive: Kp = tan²(45° + φ/2)
  ```
- **Safety Factors:**
  - Overturning: ≥ 2.0
  - Sliding: ≥ 1.5
  - Bearing pressure check
- Visual earth pressure distribution diagrams

##### 3. **REINFORCEMENT DESIGN**
- Steel design based on IS 456:2000
- Design moment calculations with safety factors
- Bar diameter and spacing optimization
- Comprehensive bar bending schedule
- Reinforcement layout drawings
- Steel utilization monitoring

##### 4. **QUANTITIES & COST ESTIMATION**
- Material quantities:
  - Concrete volume (m³)
  - Steel reinforcement (kg)
  - Formwork area (m²)
  - Excavation volume (m³)
- Real-time cost estimation
- Economic comparison charts
- Customizable material rates

##### 5. **REPORTS & EXPORT**
- Professional design summary reports
- Multiple export formats:
  - PDF reports
  - Excel calculation sheets
  - JSON data export
  - DXF drawing files

### 🔬 CALCULATION METHODS

#### Earth Pressure Analysis
```python
# Rankine Active Earth Pressure
phi = math.radians(angle_of_friction)
ka = math.tan(math.pi/4 - phi/2)**2
active_pressure = ka * gamma * height
active_force = 0.5 * active_pressure * height

# Passive Earth Pressure  
kp = math.tan(math.pi/4 + phi/2)**2
passive_force = 0.5 * kp * gamma * depth**2
```

#### Stability Checks
```python
# Overturning
overturning_factor = restoring_moment / overturning_moment
overturning_safe = overturning_factor >= 2.0

# Sliding  
sliding_factor = (friction + passive) / active
sliding_safe = sliding_factor >= 1.5

# Bearing
bearing_pressure = load / effective_area
bearing_safe = bearing_pressure <= bearing_capacity
```

#### Reinforcement Design
```python
# Steel Area Calculation
design_moment = active_moment * safety_factor
ast_required = design_moment / (0.87 * fy * d * j)
ast_provided = num_bars * bar_area
```
