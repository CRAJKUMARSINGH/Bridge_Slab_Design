# WHAT CURSOR DID IN THE BRIDGE DESIGN APP TILL NOW
## Concurrent Progress Log for Development Teams

---

### üéØ Scope
Track exactly what was reviewed, decided, and changed inside this code workspace to keep all parallel teams synchronized without assumptions beyond the provided Excel/PDF sources.

---

### ‚úÖ Completed (this workspace)
- Read and indexed the prototype project folders (CHITTORGARH PWD, Devka Bridge PWD, KHERWARA BRIDGE, KHERWARA BRIDGE II, PARASRAM BRIDGE, UIT BRIDGES) to locate formula-intact Excel and corroborating PDFs.
- Read core documentation already in repo:
  - `what_warp_did_in_the_app_till_now.md`
  - `EXTRACTED_Variables_From_Excel_Sheets.md`
  - `Bridge_Design_App_Development_Schedule.md`
  - `LOG_BOOK.txt` (requirements, constraints, workflow directives)
- Implemented minimal code scaffolding strictly pending sheet-driven variables (no fixed design ‚Äúassumptions‚Äù baked-in):
  - Added abutment design module shells (Type-1 battered, Type-2 cantilever) with placeholders intended to be wired to Excel/PDF variables.
  - Added preliminary estimation hook (to be replaced by exact sheet variables) and extended report output to include abutment/estimation sections.
- Lint check run on edited Python file: clean.

---

### üîí Non-negotiable directives captured from LOG_BOOK.txt
- Use ONLY variables from actual Excel/PDFs; UIT/Kherwara = primary formula sources; Chittorgarh = dispatch copy for validation.
- Survey data: Cross-section typically 15 points (allow variable count), ~5 m spacing; L-section ~25 m (allow random intervals).
- Skew handling: Œ∏ in 15‚Äì55¬∞. Obstructed velocity modification per sheet (Pier Stability rows 79‚Äì81).
- Foundations: Start with pier size + 0.5 m projections on all sides; extend 0‚Äì5 m each side; accept when max pressure < SBC and tension area = 0.
- Phase-1: User will supply live load reactions/moments and seismic inputs; later phases automate.

---

### üìÅ Artifacts mapped (for extraction phase)
- UIT BRIDGES (primary): Stability Analysis ‚Ä¶xls, hYDRAULIC dESIGN.xls, Design of Pier Cap.xls, design of Pier Footing ‚Ä¶.xls, Design of ABUTMENT ‚Ä¶.xls, LLCALpier1 ‚Ä¶.xls, liveloadtyp ‚Ä¶.xls; supporting PDFs/DWGs.
- KHERWARA BRIDGE (primary): hydraulics.xls, Stability Analysis ‚Ä¶.xls, stability pdf/*.pdf (afflux, stability check pier, abut foot/cap, steel p1/p2, bed slope, deck anchorage), cross section.xls.
- CHITTORGARH PWD: Dispatch copies; use to validate outputs only.
- PARASRAM/Devka: Additional cross-checks for sheet patterns and components.

---

### üß© Code changes in this repo (scoped, sheet-aligned placeholders)
- `bridge_design_app.py`
  - Added `AbutmentDesignType1` and `AbutmentDesignType2` classes as wiring points for sheet variables (geometry, loads, foundation check logic to be driven by Excel values).
  - Extended `PierDesign` with explicit pier cap thickness property and included cap info in results.
  - Added `_estimate_quantities` as a temporary hook; to be fully replaced by sheet-derived calculations once variable tables are bound.
  - Updated report generation to include abutment and estimation summaries.
  - Lints: none.

Note: These edits are placeholders to integrate extracted variables; hard-coded numerics are to be removed/replaced during binding to actual sheet cells.

---

### üîÑ In Progress (no assumptions; extraction-first)
- Prepare sheet-wise variable dictionaries (name, symbol, cell ref, units, equation) from:
  - UIT: hYDRAULIC dESIGN.xls; Stability Analysis ‚Ä¶xls; Design of ABUTMENT ‚Ä¶xls; Design of Pier Cap.xls; design of Pier Footing ‚Ä¶xls; LLCALpier1 ‚Ä¶xls; liveloadtyp ‚Ä¶.xls
  - KHERWARA: hydraulics.xls; Stability Analysis ‚Ä¶xls; stability pdf/*.pdf; cross section.xls
- Define JSON schema for imported variables to feed the app, including skew adjustments and trial‚Äìerror sequencing parameters.

---

### üéØ Next Actions requested from user
- Select baseline project for first extraction pass:
  - UIT BRIDGES ‚Üí Bridge Nr Police Chowki (recommended), or
  - KHERWARA BRIDGE ‚Üí Stability + hydraulics.
- Confirm abutment priority order for detailed variable tables:
  - Type-1 (UIT) then Type-2 (Chittorgarh), or vice versa.

Once confirmed, we will extract variables and equations verbatim (with cell addresses), then wire the code to those variables, removing all placeholders.

---

### üìå Operating principles for concurrency
- No code logic beyond what‚Äôs evidenced in Excel/PDFs.
- Every variable must trace to a sheet cell or documented PDF formula.
- Drafts are allowed only to scaffold data flow; calculations are sheet-sourced.
- Maintain this log alongside `what_warp_did_in_the_app_till_now.md` as the engineering execution ledger.
